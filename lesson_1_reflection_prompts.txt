How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By seeing the difference between the old and new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help see mistakes, and save time trying to fix mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You get clear and timely commits. Cons: You may forget when to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some files connect with each other, so they need to change across the board.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use the id's to see and compare different versions of your files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to an earlier version, to see what went wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to put my web files into GitHub.
